//! Condensation on the player's bus's windows: the cabin's air and the water it leaves on
//! the glass, worked out as it happens in a real bus.
//!
//! * The cabin's heat: the heating's convectors draw on the engine's coolant, which warms up
//!   over some minutes once the engine runs; the people give off their body heat; the body's
//!   skin and the air that leaves carry heat to the street. The cabin's air and its fittings
//!   (seats, panels, floor) warm and cool together.
//! * Its water vapour comes from the people breathing in it - some 45 g an hour each, the
//!   driver included, and more from wet coats while it rains or snows - and goes with the
//!   air that leaves: the fans' few air changes an hour, the airstream through the vents
//!   while driving, far more through an open door.
//! * A pane's inner face settles between the cabin's air and the street's by the heat each
//!   side carries to it: still air inside (some 8 W/m²K), outside a film that grows with
//!   the speed the bus drives through the air. The windscreen has the heater's warm air
//!   blown up it (the defroster): where the jet's glass is warm enough to dry, it clears
//!   from below as fast as the jet evaporates the film.
//! * Where the glass is colder than the cabin air's dew point, water condenses on it at the
//!   rate the air brings the vapour there (the heat transfer's mass analogue, Lewis'
//!   relation); where it is warmer, the film evaporates again. A few grams a square metre of
//!   fine droplets is a milky film; tens of grams run together into drops.
//!
//! A bus full of wet passengers on an autumn evening fogs up within minutes, its windscreen
//! clear in a widening patch above the defroster; an empty bus on a dry winter's day stays
//! clear, and a cold bus stood with its engine off fogs up as soon as people breathe in it.
